**RecruiterBot** is a Telegram chatbot that takes any job offer and transforms it into a simulated technical interview session powered by AI.

The idea came to life on a Sunday after reading an inspiring post by David Hurtado TorÃ¡n. His message â€” *"The best way to predict the future is to build it"* â€” pushed me to turn curiosity into action that very day.

- Generates contextual technical questions using GPT
- Asks questions and listens to your answers
- Provides AI-driven feedback to help improve interview performance

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Telegram Bot API

### ðŸš§ Future Enhancements
